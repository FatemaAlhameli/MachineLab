## Homework April 24 - Button and LED

In the previous week we added our music maker shield and a loudspeaker. We were able to successfully play sound through them. Additionally, we added a button to our breadboard and an LED in order to trigger the activity of our project. To test this we had the neopixels and sound start when the button is pressed and then the LED will turn on when the activity ends. We were able to get it to work however, the neopixels just turned on when the sound played and continued to change colors only after the sound ended. We werenâ€™t sure why it kept doing that. Moreover, the LED just kept flickering the whole time instead of turning on at the end. For this text we used the sample code Professor provided us with and adjusted to our activities code. So far the trigger action is working! We will need to adjust the bugs with the neopixels and LED.
