# Project Technical Details
### Salama Almheiri, Noah Pietrafesa, and Fatema Alhameli

#### Boat Ride
Materials Needed:
* Giant Servo Motor
* Speakers (Sound)
* 2 Neopixel strips
* Wood
* Cardboard 
* Paint

Details:
The boat is attached to the motor by strings and covered with neopixels. 
Hidden speaker to add sound effects of the ride.

#### Water Waves
Materials Needed:
* Servo motor
* Laser cut wood 
* Paint
  

Details:
2- 3 Layers of laser cut waves, each attached to a motor.


#### Clam Shells
Materials Needed:
* Servo Motors
* LEDs
* Material for Shell Structure (or real shells) 
* Transparent 3D Printed Sphere (Pearl)

Details:
The bottom shell is stable and fixed to the board.
While the top shell is attached to the bottom shell at one end (hinge) and has a string attached at the top of the shell that is attached to a moving servo. 


#### Other
* Speakers (Sound)
* Wooden structure (platform) to hide the components underneath.

#### Most risky, complicated, or frightening element of the project:
The most risky and complicated component of your project would be both the swinging boat ride and the water waves movement. We will need to design a lightweight boat structure that easily attaches to the giant servo motor, while also ensuring a smooth and effortless back and forth swinging motion. As per the theme park concept, we would like to incorporate neopixels along the strings attached to the motor to complement the theme. Additionally, the moving water waves will be placed under the boat ride therefore we will need to carefully measure the distance between both elements. Ultimately, we need to consider factors such as speed, height, and frequency of the waves while coordinating them with the boat rideâ€™s motion.
