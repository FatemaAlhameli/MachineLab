## MARCH 25 - PROGRESS

### Boat Model 
To create the final boat model we decided to prototype the boat by laser cutting using plastic material. We used the Slicer for Fusion 360 to program the laser cutting outline. We simply did this by uploading our 3D model and selected the stacking construction technique. After laser cutting we began assembling the model however, we found that the height and width dimensions needed to be increased. Therefore, for our next steps for the boat model we will adjust the dimensions and use plywood. Since we will be using plywood we will attach all the parts using wood glue. From there we will create a hanger that will attach the boat to the motor.

### Sound 

We used the Adafruit Music Maker Shield to connect to the Ardunio and produce sound. To do so we downloaded a sound file of people screaming on a ride and uploaded it to the sim card. We then soldered headers onto the shield and then connected it to the Ardunio. We first connected headphones to test out the sound and it worked! Lastly, we connected the loud speaker Professor provided us with.
