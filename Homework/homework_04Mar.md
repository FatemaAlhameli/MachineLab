## MARCH 4 - PROGRESS

### Wave Mechanism 

We are planning to have 2 layers of moving waves, so we designed the waves in illustrator then we laser cut them on thin plywood. We created a track for the waves using cardboard and glued them on another piece of cardboard to prototype the mechanism. To create the left and right movement, we used two servo motors and placed them on each side of the waves. By creating holes on the sides of the waves we tied strings to the servo motor attachments. We programmed the servos to move at the same time with the same directions.
