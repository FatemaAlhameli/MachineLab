## Nature Theme

This particular theme is great to work on as a class, as it offers a variety of possibilities. For instance, each of the 4 groups can work on a specific nature scenery they are interested in. 

#### Rough Suggestions

Group 1: Water

Group 2: Forest and Trees

Group 3: The Desert 

Group 4: Mountains 

#### Water

This project will illustrate the dynamic movement of water waves as a backdrop, complemented with two or three animals and a boat drifting amidst the waves. Adding to the scene, there will be multiple differently shaped shells positioned in front of the water, demonstrating their opening and closing motions. Additionally, the interaction will include music that depicts the sounds of water and waves. The materials that will be utilized for the project aesthetic will mainly be laser cut wood sheets, paint, 3D printed objects, and other props. As for electric and mechanical, for movement we will need servos, LEDS for light when the shells open and close, bolts, etc. The main equipment that we will need is the laser cutter and maybe 3D Printer. Artistic, programming, and creativity are all skills needed for this project. Although the elements of the project are not final and may be altered, below are some rough sketches.
