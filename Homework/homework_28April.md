We were successfully able to get out button, sound, neopixels, and LED to work with the 5V power supply. Our next step is to wire the servo motors and clam LEDâ€™s to the 5V power supply. Additionally, we secured the clams by creating a platform and glueing it and the clams onto the board. We also cut down a bit of the piece of wood holding the giant motor for the boat. This way we have more space for the swinging motion. Our next step is to wiring everything to the Ardunio and power supplies.
