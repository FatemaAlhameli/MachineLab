## April 1 - Progress

### Wave 

We decided to slightly change up our wave movement mechanism by adding springs. We came to a realization that using two servo motors to pull each end of the wave might have issues in the long term as they could potentially unsync. Since the clock will be running for a whole year we wanted a sustainable mechanism that would last. Therefore, instead of having two servos for each wave, we will have one per each and add springs on the other sides. This way when the servo pulls, the spring stretches and pulls back when the servo loosens its grip. Additionally, we decided to use chains as opposed to strings mainly because strings can wear out  with time.

### Clamps

For our clamps we initially had real clamps that we were going to use, however, since they are real they are very fragile. We tried drilling a hole in one of them but it cracked. Therefore, we found a 3D model of a clamp and 3D printed it. In addition, we printed the pearl that will be placed inside of the clamps in transparent filament so that the LED color can go through. 

As shown below in the images we tested out the LED and in the pearl and it looked great! Moreover, we began prototyping the opening and closing mechanism of the clamp but it is still a working progress. We were having challenges with the servo movement.
