## PROGRESS - April 8

### Boat
During this week we have completed our final boat structure. After a few prototypes we have finally reached our desired design and dimensions. To create this final structure we used thin wood pieces and wooden sticks. We began by creating a pointy oval shaped base and supports along the side. We proceeded to cover the outer part of the boat with thin rectangular wood pieces until the boat was covered. To secure all the pieces we used both super glue and wood glue which worked pretty well. After creating our boat we designed a hanger part that would be attached to the boat from the bottom and mounted to the motor from the top. To design this part we used illustrator and then laser cut on thick plywood. Additionally, we laser cut two more circles to be mounted on the motor in order to create space between the boat and the wooden base that is behind it.

### Shells 
Moreover, this week we have finalized the clamps opening and closing mechanism. We decided to use fishing string to connect the servo motor to the shell. In addition, we 3D printed the second clamp and began preparing its wiring. We also began planning how we will hide the servo motors of the clamps. We will laser cut a stationary wave and drill holes to hide the motors behind. Below is a video of the clamps opening and closing:

### Next Steps 
* Paint and decorate boat to fit the pirate theme 
* Mount boat onto the motor and attach the neopixels
* Paint the clamps
