## Prototype
For our homework assignment, we decided to work on the boat movement as it is the main component of our project and the most difficult part. Therefore, we worked on a prototype that we created using cardboard. We cut out a 2D structure of the boat and attached it to a servo motor by using hot glue. As we were restricted with the materials, we had access to we settled with using a servo motor for our prototype. We coded the servo motor to move back and forth at a 180-degree angle. Once the boat was attached to the motor and the movement worked, we needed to attach the motor to a base. This was the most challenging part as we found it difficult to stable the motor. After exploring multiple ways to attach the motor through zip ties, glue, tape, we were able to find a solution. Using cardboard, we created a cylinder shaped base and used a small rectangular shaped cardboard to tape the motor on. We then hot glued the motor platform onto the base.

### Next Steps
Prototyping helped us find out what and how we were going to build the final version of our boat ride. 

1.	A larger motor that is stabilized using a bracket onto our box.
2.	A wooden base for the motor and bracket to sit on.
3.	A rod to attach the boat to the motor.

### Code
 Controlling the motor was straightforward to do, we were able to get the motion we wanted.
