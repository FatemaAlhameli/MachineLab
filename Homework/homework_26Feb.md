## Homework - 26 February 

We created a rough sketch of the dimensions and space we will be working with for this project. A challenge we have to work with is ensuring that we have enough swinging space. As shown in the video, the swinging motion is currently a bit large. Therefore, we will need to adjust the swinging scale further to fit the dimensions of the space we are limited to. In addition to the boat component, we will include the moving waves right under the boat in order to fill up the space in between. We are still working on the wave mechanism, however to prepare we laser cut the waves from plywood and created a track from cardboard where the waves will be placed. As illustrated in the sketch the opening and closing clamps will be placed in front of the waves.

### Neopixels 
We decided the neopixels will be placed on the wooden piece that is mounted on the motor as it is in the center and would be a great place to decorate lights. Our challenge and next step with the neopixels would be to attach them without the wire getting tangled from the swinging motion. 
For the code, we used the neopixel example in the Arduino library and adjusted the colors and blinking feature to the strip we had.
