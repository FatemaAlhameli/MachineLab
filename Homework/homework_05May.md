## Progress - May 5

In the past week we have mounted our Ardunio and wired all of our connections and power supplies. We labeled power supplies that are connected to our 5V and 12V elements. We also tested it out and our waves, shells, LEDs, and neopixels work! However, at times the servos become jittery. We have yet to test our giant motor with the rest of the servos, neopixels, and sound.
