Our project finally works! After hour of detection we managed to have all of our mechanism to work as we wished. Although we struggled with the music maker shield and had to make some last minute changes everything worked al together. In order to have the sound and mechanisms work at the same time we added two buttons instead of one. One was to activate the sound and the other the movement of the boat, waves, shells, and lights.
