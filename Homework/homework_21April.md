## PROGRESS - April 21

### Boat Installed

We successfully attached the hanger on the motor using nuts and bolts. We drilled holes on each piece and screwed them on two nuts, bolts, and washers. In the picture below you can see how we were able to secure them. Our next step was to attach the boat to the hanger. To do so, we used wire. Since the boat is lightweight we drilled two holes on each side of the boat and drilled holes on each side of the hanger. We wrapped the wire through all the drilled holes and tightened into a knot. This technique seemed to work well as it held the boat pretty steady. Additionally we put glue between the pieces to ensure that itâ€™s more secure.

### More Waves

We laser cut two more pieces of waves in the AMW, a larger and smaller one. The smaller one will be static and will not, this is because it will serve as a decoration to hide the servo motors for the clamps. We also spray painted the waves.
